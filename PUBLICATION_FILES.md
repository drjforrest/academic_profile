# Publication Files System

This document explains the systematic file naming convention for your publications.

## üìÅ Directory Structure

```
src/public/pdf/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ thumbnails/          # Publication thumbnail images
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [publication files]  # PDF files
```

## üè∑Ô∏è Naming Convention

**Format**: `{publication-slug}.{extension}`

All files use the same base filename (the publication slug) with different extensions:
- PDFs: `{slug}.pdf`
- Thumbnails: `{slug}.jpg` (or `.png`)
