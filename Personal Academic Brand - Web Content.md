## Optimizing Disruptive Innovation for Health Equity

My mission is to **ensure digital transformation minimizes—not widens—global health disparities.**Across projects from pandemic clinical trials to AI governance, I build equitable research ecosystems grounded in data sovereignty, rapid evidence generation, and local agency.

**Core Research Interests:**

- **AI Governance & Health Equity:** Advancing practices and protections so artificial intelligence drives equitable health outcomes—especially in emergencies.

- **Digital Health Information Systems:** Integrating technology in resource-limited contexts with a focus on sustainability and community ownership.

- **Resilient Clinical Research Infrastructure:** Designing adaptive methods and partnerships to accelerate rigorous evidence when it matters most.

- **Misinformation & Information Integrity:** Studying the impacts of digital misinformation on public health trust, especially for marginalized groups.

- **Community-Centred Implementation Science:** Using participatory, iterative methods to authentically engage and empower communities in health innovation.

- **Technology Equity & Data Sovereignty:** Analyzing global power, access, and control in digital health, to center local voices and priorities.
